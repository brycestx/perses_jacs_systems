This directory contains prepared input `.pdb` and `.sdf` files for openmm from test systems provided as supplementary material in the JACS publication: [Accurate and Reliable Prediction of Relative Ligand Binding Potency in Prospective Drug Discovery by Way of a Modern Free-Energy Calculation Protocol and Force Field](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja512751q)

The `.pdb` inputs were generated by [pdbfixer](https://github.com/pandegroup/pdbfixer.git) and can be regenerated by running the script `run_pdbfixer.sh` in each system directory.
