This directory contains prepared input `.pdb` and `.sdf` files for openmm from test systems provided as supplementary material in the JACS publication: [Accurate and Reliable Prediction of Relative Ligand Binding Potency in Prospective Drug Discovery by Way of a Modern Free-Energy Calculation Protocol and Force Field](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja512751q)

The `.pdb` inputs were generated by [pdb4amber](https://github.com/Amber-MD/pdb4amber.git) and [pdbfixer](https://github.com/pandegroup/pdbfixer.git) and can be regenerated by running the script `../run_pdbfixer.sh ${target}_protein.pdb` in each system directory.

This repo assumes you have defined `$AMBERHOME` and have `pdb4amber` and `pdbfixer` in your `$PATH`, for example:

`source $AMBERHOME/amber.sh` 

`export PATH=$AMBERHOME/bin:/home/ballen/anaconda2/bin:$PATH`
